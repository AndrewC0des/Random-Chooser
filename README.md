# Random-Chooser
  Important: This project is not done and is still being updated.
  This projects aims to choose meaningless things for me. Like where to eat and what to start doing. It solves the decision paralysis that I often face.

  This application was also built as an exercise for myself in persistent data and MVVM. It uses a room database to save the user created groups and the items in the group.

  Updates to come:
    Improved looks
    Ability to delete a single item out of a group.
    Using relation to store the items. (They are currently stored in the CSV string).
